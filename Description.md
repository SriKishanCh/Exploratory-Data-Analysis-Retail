Business Analysis Task: Weak Areas for Profit Improvement

Objective:
The objective of this business analysis task was to identify weak areas within the business where profits can be improved. The task involved analyzing sales data to pinpoint areas with lower profitability and uncover opportunities for sales enhancement.

Task Accomplished:

To accomplish the task, the following steps were undertaken:

1. Region Selection:
- A slicer component was implemented in the Power BI dashboard, allowing users to select a specific region for analysis.

2. Sales by Top 10 Cities:
- A stacked bar chart was created to showcase the sales performance of the top 10 cities within the selected region. This visualization highlighted cities with higher sales and identified potential profitable areas.

3. Sales by Bottom 10 Cities:
- A stacked bar chart was utilized to illustrate the sales performance of the bottom 10 cities within the selected region. This visualization identified cities with lower sales, indicating areas that required attention for profit improvement.

4. Sales and Profit by Region:
- A stacked column chart was implemented to display sales and profit figures for each region. This chart facilitated a comparison of regional performance, enabling the identification of regions with lower profitability that needed further analysis.

5. Sales by Category:
- A donut chart was used to present the distribution of sales across different categories. This visualization helped identify categories that contributed significantly to sales and highlighted areas that may require improvement.

6. Sales by Subcategory:
- A pie chart was employed to illustrate the sales breakdown by subcategory. This visualization provided a detailed analysis of subcategories and identified potential areas for profit enhancement.

7. Sales Heatmap by Region:
- A map visualization, such as a heatmap or color-coded map, represented sales intensity by region. This visual representation offered a quick overview of regions with higher or lower sales, highlighting areas that required attention.

Conclusion:

By analyzing the sales data through the Power BI dashboard, weak areas with lower profitability were successfully identified. The stacked bar charts for top and bottom cities provided insights into the sales performance of different cities within the selected region. The stacked column chart enabled a comparison of sales and profit figures across regions, pinpointing regions requiring further analysis. Additionally, the donut chart and pie chart facilitated an understanding of sales distribution by category and subcategory, respectively.

Overall, the Power BI dashboard allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the sales data, identifying areas with weaker performance and offering opportunities for profit improvement. With these insights, informed decisions can be made to maximize profitability and drive business growth.
